Statement 
Chris Smith (Rt Hon Lord Smith of Finsbury)    

Universities matter more than ever in these difficult times.  The Chancellor must be a champion for Cambridge, and for the role the University plays in fostering learning and knowledge.  We live in a dangerous world of misinformation and “fake news”.  Universities are the places where facts are researched and honoured, where information is discovered and tested and debated.  It is why a genuine commitment to freedom of speech is so important.  It is no accident that the first target of autocrats everywhere is education; tyrants do not want people to have and acquire knowledge.  The Chancellor has above all to be an advocate for the vital importance of knowledge and expertise.  
I believe I have much to offer the University as Chancellor:  

•	Proven leadership:  As Secretary of State for Culture, I established NESTA, the Foundation for Youth Music, Creative Partnerships for Schools, funding for Olympic athletes, the switchover to digital television, and made all the national museums and galleries free.  I believe that the best politics and governance are non-partisan; I was appointed as Chairman of the Environment Agency by a Labour Secretary of State, and reappointed by a Conservative.  After leaving Government, I led the parliamentary opposition to the Iraq war; I was the Founding Director of the Clore Leadership Programme in the arts and culture; and I became Chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority for ten years.  Since 2015 I have been Master of Pembroke.    

•	A commitment to diversity, openness and ethics:  In 1984 I became the first MP in the UK voluntarily to come out as gay.  When I was appointed to the Cabinet in 1997 I was the first openly gay Cabinet Minister anywhere in the world.  I have always set great store by openness and  transparency in public life; it is important always to stand up for what you believe in.   

•	A record of successful fundraising:  During my Mastership of Pembroke, we have expanded the footprint of the College by a third with our Mill Lane development; and we have successfully raised £82 million to complete it.         

•	A strong commitment to Academic and Collegiate Cambridge:  I read English as an undergraduate at Pembroke, from 1969 to 1972; I went on to do a PhD on Wordsworth and Coleridge and graduated with my doctorate in 1979.  I spent a year at Harvard as a Kennedy Scholar.  I am now the President of the Wordsworth Trust.  I believe someone who has a record of successfully leading a College, and who understands the fundamental importance of the relationship between the University and the Colleges, has the right background to become Chancellor.  
Cambridge is one of the leading Universities of the world, devoted to teaching, learning and research.  We are a genuine centre of excellence, a major national and international asset for Britain.  We must channel all our energy into sustaining and developing that excellence.  I hope to be given the chance to play my role in that, as Chancellor.
