I need to create a single page, responsive website for Lord Chris Smith's campaign to become Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. 

His manifesto is in `statement.txt` and endorsements from famous supporters are in endorsements.txt and his official portrait is `images/Chris Smith.jpg`. Responsive images are in images/responsive/. There are also a number of other images/ which it would be nice to use throughout the site of Chris in different circumstances. Figure out how to weave them into the overall design, perhaps as carousels.

First, ultrathink about statement.txt and break it down into a nice single page web page structure, and write that into STRUCTURE.md as an outline.

We then need a single index.html that distills these into a beautiful, dignified HTML style that first summarises the overall manifesto for and then dives into the details. Incorporate the portrait picture of Chris Smith into the scrolling of the site so that it's present in the background. A good structure would be to have:

- A key quote from Chris "Universities matter more than ever in these difficult times. The Chancellor must be a champion for Cambridge, and for the role the University plays in fostering learning and knowledge." in bold letters.
- Then a rolling carousel of the endorsements that automatically advances and rotates.
- Then his manifesto summarised, with a 'read full statement' that expands to the full text when clicked.
- then a 'voting information' section with the 'in person voting' and online voting information from below. Also note that if an alumni has missed the registration deadline, they are still eligible to vote in person!

Some other key links to include are details about how to vote:
- "Check you are eligible to vote" https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/people/chancellor/election-of-the-next-chancellor/how-to-register-for-online-voting (it is open to any alumni of the University of Cambridge as well as current members)
