I need to create a single page, responsive website for Lord Chris Smith's campaign to become Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.

His manifesto is in `statement.txt` and his official portrait is `chris-smith-portrait.jpg`.

First, ultrathink about statement.txt and break it down into a nice single page web page structure, and write that into STRUCTURE.md as an outline.

We then need a single index.html that distills these into a beautiful, dignified HTML style that first summarises the overall manifesto for and then dives into the details. Incorporate the portrait picture of Chris Smith into the scrolling of the site so that it's present in the background. 


Some other key links to include are details about how to vote:
- "Check you are eligible to vote" https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/people/chancellor/election-of-the-next-chancellor/how-to-register-for-online-voting (it is open to any alumni of the University of Cambridge as well as current members)
